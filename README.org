** Principle
*** Grow everything in an oragnic way
- People have been forced to endorse you
*** Talk just like face-to-face
*** Short sentence win
*** No matter you post or comment, make sure it add values to your audience
*** Fake won't work. You have to be real and serious.
*** Boostbluffing < Talk < Listen < Learn
*** Reach out people and offer helps
*** Real and deep conversations starts from private messages
*** Treat every audience as a respectful professional
** Routine tasks
*** [#A] Send private messages, if you notice some inspiring comments
*** Add comments, instead of likes: It helps to promote yourself
*** Every moning take 5 minutes: Check Selective Friends LinkedIn Updates
*** Send Invitations for people likes or comments your updates
Not everyone in Linkedin are active
*** Send out private messages to close friends regularly
*** Find questions to answers
- People may post updates with their problems (@ you or won’t @ you)
- People may comment your update with their problems
- search LinkedIn technical questions, send private messages, and build connections
- Start conversation broadly, then start private conversation for more deep insight and under hood feedback
*** Send connection invitation for who likes/comments my Linkedin updates for this week
*** Add discussion summary, @people selectively
Sample: 
*** For discussion, @people for friends who might be interested
** Lessons learned
*** You com here to learn, instead of teach or sell
*** Only selectively topics are discussed on the internet
*** Always remember: Lots of experienced professionals are inactive in social media
*** Avoid talking nonsense or common sense: waste times for both sides
** Puzzle
*** How to properly backup LinkedIn chat history?
Route your active friends/fans into your slack group.
*** TODO Identity who is connected with me but don't follow me
*** TODO How to identity connections who has little common interest with me
*** TODO How to identity connections who has less than 100 connections
** Maintain A Topic
*** Avoid getting people distracted from your original topic
*** Ask the Right questions in a suitable question
*** Add a recap after 3 days: summarize the discussions
** Benefits
*** Get feedbacks for technical details
*** Get *the direction or trends* for the tech community
** Start a topic
*** Start with a real story from yourself: it's ok to make fun of yourself, as long as it's real
*** Start with an easy and open question: either useful or funny
*** Explain your question in a simple and easy-to-understand way: People are careless and biasd
*** As long as people want to say something, and easy to chimp in mind
** How To reply
*** Speak out people's name, and speak with due respect!
** Build Connections From Discussions
*** Add connections and endorsement from Linkedin Discussions
** LinkedIn Role Models
- Be connected with Active publisher in Linkedin Groups

Looks like stack overflow is a better place for this kind of questions.

F.Y.I 

I usually use LinkedIn to ask for experience and directions. Instead of tech details.
For specific issues, we usually can fix with enough reading and testing sooner or later.

After all, any skilled IT professional would already be very busy with his/her daily work. Right, my friend?

Hey Denny,   I have a quick question to ask. Since you have a good number of devops connections in your profile, I would like to know following:  1. How are you managing your DHCP server? What are you doing for IP reservations? 2. Is there any open source tool you can suggest to manage DHCP, which can work like IPAM (IP Management Tool).  It would be a nice discussion and lot to learn I think so. What you say?  Regards, Savitoj Singh
 Savitoj Singh
It would be nice if you can ask these questions so that your connections can give us more insights. Thank you
Hi Savitoj, thanks for asking.   Frankly speaking, I don't quite get your painpoint.   I think it would be more effective, if you can do more thinking and researching. Then you can post your questions in Linkedin or stackoverflow directly.
4:04 PM
Savitoj Singh sent the following message at 4:07 PM
 Savitoj Singh
Hey Denny,  No problem at all. You're right, I'll do more research and post.  Thank you

Denny Zhang sent the following messages at 4:09 PM
Nowadays most people are living in the world of public cloud.  This makes local DHCP less popular. Surely your problem matters for your project. I fully understand that.
Just I don't want to spam people with things they may not be interested. Hope you understand, my friend.

Hey, nice reading your profile. I am currently a full stack python developer, and i have now experience with shell script and linux and i am comfortable with both of these. I am writing to you as i am very uncertain as to what to choose for my career. I ahve done courses on puppet, ansible, docker and AWS solutions architect and i use them in my personal projects. I also have experience with machine learning and have been doing projects on the same. I wanted to seek your help on how should i direct my career towards. I desperately need your inputs. Thanks :)

I am not very clear, i just know one thing that i am very confident that i can do whatever i want to do. I am very persistent and hard working. But i lack a good mentorship and direction. Any help would be deeply appreciated.
 Akash Ranjan
I can do whatever the market demands as a prestigious role or say i am interested in doing a sophisticated and complicated tasks.

Denny Zhang sent the following message at 9:00 AM
I think that's a question for yourself, Akash. Everyone needs to find his/her own way.  Not sure whether it helps. Here is my story. When I graduated from the college, I evaluated my weakness and strength. (As a newbie, you can't get it right and accurate.)  I know I'm not interested as salesmen, and I don't feel comfortable if I say something I can't understand or believe.  Then I find my best job I can, which it's EMC. Inside EMC, it takes several years to understand my passion: keep polishing and improving things.  Afterwards I swift from IaaS engineer, to PaaS, to full stack. And now devops.  To be simple, understand yourself and your desire. Follow your passion. Don't follow the money. It will come, if you can bring values to others.

You're on your own for this journey. Keep thinking.  Follow your passion, or at least what interests you.  Dedication and determination are the keys. And any serious achievements will take several years' hard work.   Remember don't follow the money. You will be mislead easily.

Try google . Docker compose is a very typical solution in container world. 

My blog is supposed to serve DevOps community. And docker is default skill for DevOps professionals.

Sorry I really don't have bandwidth to support people who are not in the target audience. You are on your own now. Good luck.

[70e69c46e9]
William Arruda , Contributor
I write about personal branding. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.

I have written several articles about LinkedIn, and they often generate the most comments. Here are
the highlights of my LinkedIn advice from previous articles, along with additional tips and tricks,
many of which remain unspoken by the people at LinkedIn. With this checklist in hand, you can make
your LinkedIn profile your best personal branding tool. These little-known, often-overlooked and
seemingly counterintuitive tips deliver big results with minimal effort.

1. Be secretive. When you’re updating your LinkedIn profile, it can annoy your contacts if they’re
alerted to every little change. When you’re in edit mode, head to your privacy controls. Turn off
activity broadcasts and change the setting for  “select who can see your activity feed” to “only
you.”

2. Be opportunistic. Join groups that will let you connect with people who are in your target
audience but are not contacts. Being part of the group gives you permission to reach out to them
and invite them to join your network. You don’t need to upgrade to Premium to do so.

3. Be redundant. Know the top five strengths for which you want to be recognized and use them in
your profile – repeatedly. If your top skill is project management, describe your project
management proficiency in your summary as well as in multiple experience descriptions. This will
help the right audience find you.

4. Be ungrateful. Ask your contacts to endorse you for only your top skills. Having the highest
number of endorsements for your signature strengths will influence those who are looking at your
profile. Have the courage to delete or reject the endorsements that aren’t central to how you want
to be known.

5. Be stingy. Only give recommendations and endorsements to those whom you genuinely admire. When
you recommend other people, their reputation is seen an extension of your values.

6. Be lazy. Reuse and repurpose the content you already have available. This amplifies your message
and delivers brand consistency. Communicating different forms of the same content in distinctive
ways helps reinforce your messages within your brand community. Convert your Blog posts into
activity updates and embed whitepapers and articles in your profile.

The Forbes eBook: Find And Keep Your Dream Job
The Definitive Careers Guide From Forbes encompasses every aspect of the job hunt, from interview
to promotion. Written by some of Forbes' best careers and leadership writers, it is available now
for download.

7. Be greedy. Don’t follow the LinkedIn formula of creating one experience entry for each job title
you have held. Take the space you need to communicate your accomplishments by creating multiple
entries for every role you have performed within each job title. It’s OK to have overlapping dates.
See how I did it in my profile.

8. Be a groupie. Don’t limit the number of groups you join. Join groups related to your area of
expertise, industry, alumni, passions, social causes, and other aspects of your identity. This
gives you access to more people who matter to your brand. Plus, when others look at your profile,
they can learn about your brand by looking at your groups. Always select groups that are highly
active and have a lot of members.

9. Be promiscuous. Ignore LinkedIn’s advice to only accept connection requests from people you
know. That helps sell Premium, but it doesn’t help you get found. LinkedIn’s search algorithm
favors those who are in your network. That means when people are looking for what you have to
offer, the results of their searches are displayed with 1^st level connections first, then 2^nd
level connections and so on.

10. Be a chameleon. Don’t assume others know how you spell your name or know that you’ve changed
your name. Include all known misspellings, previous names, nicknames and aliases in your summary. I
include this: AKA/Common misspellings: Bill Arruda, Will Arruda, William Aruda, Will Aruda.

11. Be invisible. Fly under the radar when you’re using LinkedIn to check out your employees or
poach talent. To keep your agenda hidden, change your viewing setting to “anonymous” in “Select
what others see when you've viewed their profile.”

12. Be verbose. Know the character limit for each section and use every character. This gives you
the opportunity to repeat keywords that are critical to being found. You can find the character
limits here.

13. Be opinionated. Integrate your point of view (POV) into your summary and experience where
appropriate. Join groups where you can share your POV as it relates to your area of expertise. It’s
a great way to distinguish yourself from competitors.

14. Be disorganized. Reorder the content in your profile (yes, LinkedIn made this possible). This
enables you to lead with what’s important and choose which strengths to focus on. Bonus: it will
make your profile stand out from the crowd of others who do what you do.

15. Be selective. Don’t feel you need to include every detail of every job you have had –
especially if the details dilute your brand message. You can omit the jobs you had early in your
career if they don’t offer insights into how you deliver value today. Or group those older listings
under one heading, such as “Apprenticeships” or “My Training Ground.”

16. Be square. Direct people to your LinkedIn profile with a QR code on your business card. The
next time you’re at a networking function, the people you meet can scan your QR code and instantly
read your profile and connect with you.

17. Be frugal. If you want to reach out to someone and you can’t reach them any other way, sign up
for Premium by the month. Then, do all the outreach you need to do to connect with those
super-exclusive contacts. Mission accomplished? Cancel your Premium subscription.

18. Be a thief. Repurpose the great content in your LinkedIn profile for other social media sites.
You’ll increase your digital footprint while ensuring consistency. VisualizeMe.com, Vizify.com,
Re.vu, and ResumUp.com are a few services to check out.

19. Be personal.  Your profile is not a resume or CV. Write as if you are having a conversation
with someone. Inject your personality. Let people know your values and passions. In your summary,
discuss what you do outside of work. You want people to want to know you.

20. Be in their face. Make sure your headshot is high quality, with good lighting and ultra-sharp
focus. LinkedIn is not the place to run a casual snapshot. Also, make sure that you’re either
facing forward or turned toward your left shoulder, in the direction of your content. If you’re
looking to your right, gazing off the screen, this sends a subtle message that you don’t believe
the content of your own page.

21. Be a bean counter. Get at least 500 connections. In addition to widening your target audience,
the magic 500+ in your profile has a psychological impact on those who view your profile.

22. Be a procrastinator. Don’t reach out to contacts until you are thrilled with your profile. When
you reach out the others, they will likely view your profile before deciding if they want to
connect with you.

Hi Denny,  Thanks for the connection, I'm starting a new role in November as a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer (AWS, IaC, Jenkins) supporting multiple dev teams. I've read a few of your blog posts through mutual connections and I'm keen to absorb as much as I can from more experiences DevOps professionals.   Cheers, Jeff

Denny Zhang sent the following message at 8:02 AM
So, Jeff, you're not on board yet. If I were you, I would start contacting the my customers. The dev teams.  1. Talk with them, listen to them. Understand the problems and the painpoints. Make friends with them.  2. Know the major toolset in those projects. And be familiar with them. If it's not decided yet, then learn docker+Jenkins+monitoring tool(nagios?)+config mgmt tool(ansible)  3. If you want to reach out community, I'm pretty active in LinkedIn. Also there are some DevOps slack groups. devopschat, hangops. If you like, I also have one. (Search "slack" in my blog, you will see).  As a conclusion: people -> problems -> tools.
