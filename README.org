--------------------------------------------------------
** Principle
- Grow everything in an oragnic way.
- Talk just like face-to-face
- Short sentence win
- No matter you post or comment, make sure it add values to your audience
- Fake won't work. You have to be real and serious.
- Boostbluffing < Talk < Listen < Learn
- Reach out people and offer helps
- Real and deep conversations starts from private messages
- Treat every audience as a respectful professional
** Routine tasks
*** New connections
- Send private messages, if you notice some inspiring comments
- Send connection invitation for who likes/comments my Linkedin updates for this week
*** Content Management
- Add comments, instead of likes: It helps to promote yourself
- Add discussion summary, @people selectively
*** Old Connections
- Send out private messages to close friends regularly
- Every moning take 5 minutes: Check Selective Friends LinkedIn Updates
- For discussion, @people for friends who might be interested
*** Start a topic
- Start with a real story from yourself: it's ok to make fun of yourself, as long as it's real
- Start with an easy and open question: either useful or funny
- Explain your question in a simple and easy-to-understand way: People are careless and biasd
- As long as people want to say something, and easy to chimp in mind

*** Maintain a topic
- Avoid getting people distracted from your original topic
- Ask the Right questions in a suitable question
- Add a recap after 3 days: summarize the discussions
- Speak out people's name, and speak with due respect!
*** Monetize The Effort
- Get feedbacks for technical details
- Get *the direction or trends* for the tech community
*** Find questions to offer help
- People may post updates with their problems (@ you or won’t @ you)
- People may comment your update with their problems
- search LinkedIn technical questions, send private messages, and build connections
- Start conversation broadly, then start private conversation for more deep insight and under hood feedback
** Lessons learned
- You com here to learn, instead of teach or sell
- Only selectively topics are discussed on the internet
- Always remember: Lots of experienced professionals are inactive in social media
- Avoid talking nonsense or common sense: waste times for both sides

Hey, nice reading your profile. I am currently a full stack python developer, and i have now experience with shell script and linux and i am comfortable with both of these. I am writing to you as i am very uncertain as to what to choose for my career. I ahve done courses on puppet, ansible, docker and AWS solutions architect and i use them in my personal projects. I also have experience with machine learning and have been doing projects on the same. I wanted to seek your help on how should i direct my career towards. I desperately need your inputs. Thanks :)

I am not very clear, i just know one thing that i am very confident that i can do whatever i want to do. I am very persistent and hard working. But i lack a good mentorship and direction. Any help would be deeply appreciated.
 Akash Ranjan
I can do whatever the market demands as a prestigious role or say i am interested in doing a sophisticated and complicated tasks.

Denny Zhang sent the following message at 9:00 AM
I think that's a question for yourself, Akash. Everyone needs to find his/her own way.  Not sure whether it helps. Here is my story. When I graduated from the college, I evaluated my weakness and strength. (As a newbie, you can't get it right and accurate.)  I know I'm not interested as salesmen, and I don't feel comfortable if I say something I can't understand or believe.  Then I find my best job I can, which it's EMC. Inside EMC, it takes several years to understand my passion: keep polishing and improving things.  Afterwards I swift from IaaS engineer, to PaaS, to full stack. And now devops.  To be simple, understand yourself and your desire. Follow your passion. Don't follow the money. It will come, if you can bring values to others.

You're on your own for this journey. Keep thinking.  Follow your passion, or at least what interests you.  Dedication and determination are the keys. And any serious achievements will take several years' hard work.   Remember don't follow the money. You will be mislead easily.

Looks like stack overflow is a better place for this kind of questions.

F.Y.I 

I usually use LinkedIn to ask for experience and directions. Instead of tech details.
For specific issues, we usually can fix with enough reading and testing sooner or later.

After all, any skilled IT professional would already be very busy with his/her daily work. Right, my friend?

Hey Denny,   I have a quick question to ask. Since you have a good number of devops connections in your profile, I would like to know following:  1. How are you managing your DHCP server? What are you doing for IP reservations? 2. Is there any open source tool you can suggest to manage DHCP, which can work like IPAM (IP Management Tool).  It would be a nice discussion and lot to learn I think so. What you say?  Regards, Savitoj Singh
 Savitoj Singh
It would be nice if you can ask these questions so that your connections can give us more insights. Thank you
Hi Savitoj, thanks for asking.   Frankly speaking, I don't quite get your painpoint.   I think it would be more effective, if you can do more thinking and researching. Then you can post your questions in Linkedin or stackoverflow directly.

Hey Denny,  No problem at all. You're right, I'll do more research and post.  Thank you

Denny Zhang sent the following messages at 4:09 PM
Nowadays most people are living in the world of public cloud.  This makes local DHCP less popular. Surely your problem matters for your project. I fully understand that.
Just I don't want to spam people with things they may not be interested. Hope you understand, my friend.

Try google . Docker compose is a very typical solution in container world. 

My blog is supposed to serve DevOps community. And docker is default skill for DevOps professionals.

Sorry I really don't have bandwidth to support people who are not in the target audience. You are on your own now. Good luck.

Hi Denny,  Thanks for the connection, I'm starting a new role in November as a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer (AWS, IaC, Jenkins) supporting multiple dev teams. I've read a few of your blog posts through mutual connections and I'm keen to absorb as much as I can from more experiences DevOps professionals.   Cheers, Jeff

Jeff, congratulation on your new role.

Denny Zhang sent the following message at 8:02 AM
So, Jeff, you're not on board yet. If I were you, I would start contacting the my customers. The dev teams.  1. Talk with them, listen to them. Understand the problems and the painpoints. Make friends with them.  2. Know the major toolset in those projects. And be familiar with them. If it's not decided yet, then learn docker+Jenkins+monitoring tool(nagios?)+config mgmt tool(ansible)  3. If you want to reach out community, I'm pretty active in LinkedIn. Also there are some DevOps slack groups. devopschat, hangops. If you like, I also have one. (Search "slack" in my blog, you will see).  As a conclusion: people -> problems -> tools.
