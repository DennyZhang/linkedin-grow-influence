    Sure thing, Praveen. Nice to have the DevOps discussion with you in LInkedIn.  Looking forward to more in the coming weeks! I do see lots of things in common with you, Praveen.

### Doc template: Reject reply a specific question in LinkedIn<a id="sec-1-11-3" name="sec-1-11-3"></a>

    XXX
    
    Looks like stack overflow is a better place for this kind of questions.
    
    F.Y.I 
    
    I usually use LinkedIn to ask for experience and directions. Instead of tech details.
    For specific issues, we usually can fix with enough reading and testing sooner or later.
    
    After all, any skilled IT professional would already be very busy with his/her daily work. Right, my friend?

### Doc template: People ask career advice<a id="sec-1-11-4" name="sec-1-11-4"></a>

    Hey, nice reading your profile. I am currently a full stack python developer, and i have now experience with shell script and linux and i am comfortable with both of these. I am writing to you as i am very uncertain as to what to choose for my career. I ahve done courses on puppet, ansible, docker and AWS solutions architect and i use them in my personal projects. I also have experience with machine learning and have been doing projects on the same. I wanted to seek your help on how should i direct my career towards. I desperately need your inputs. Thanks :)

    Akash, thanks for asking. I don't quite get your point.  So what you want, or who you want to be?

     Akash Ranjan
    I am not very clear, i just know one thing that i am very confident that i can do whatever i want to do. I am very persistent and hard working. But i lack a good mentorship and direction. Any help would be deeply appreciated.
     Akash Ranjan
    I can do whatever the market demands as a prestigious role or say i am interested in doing a sophisticated and complicated tasks.

    Denny Zhang sent the following message at 9:00 AM
    I think that's a question for yourself, Akash. Everyone needs to find his/her own way.  Not sure whether it helps. Here is my story. When I graduated from the college, I evaluated my weakness and strength. (As a newbie, you can't get it right and accurate.)  I know I'm not interested as salesmen, and I don't feel comfortable if I say something I can't understand or believe.  Then I find my best job I can, which it's EMC. Inside EMC, it takes several years to understand my passion: keep polishing and improving things.  Afterwards I swift from IaaS engineer, to PaaS, to full stack. And now devops.  To be simple, understand yourself and your desire. Follow your passion. Don't follow the money. It will come, if you can bring values to others.

    You're on your own for this journey. Keep thinking.  Follow your passion, or at least what interests you.  Dedication and determination are the keys. And any serious achievements will take several years' hard work.   Remember don't follow the money. You will be mislead easily.

    Elsa Hill
    Hi Denny, trying to remember how we know each other ... maybe you can remind me?
    
    #  --8<-------------------------- separator ------------------------>8--
    Hi XXX
    
    I noticed we're working in DevOps field with lots of common skills.
    
    It would be nice, if we can have in-depth technical discussions on the internet.
    
    So I reach out to be connected with you, XXX.

### Doc template: reject audience who is not your target<a id="sec-1-11-6" name="sec-1-11-6"></a>

    JJ
    
    Try google . Docker compose is a very typical solution in container world. 
    
    My blog is supposed to serve DevOps community. And docker is default skill for DevOps professionals.
    
    Sorry I really don't have bandwidth to support people who are not in the target audience. You are on your own now. Good luck.

    XXX, maybe you can check this LinkedIn discussion? 
    
    https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6302225978567507968
    
    Add comments, if you need more advice. People might help.
    
    #  --8<-------------------------- separator ------------------------>8--
    XXX, I understand your pain points. You want experience, learn more and learn faster. Then get a good job offer.
    
    However it's hard for me to answer that. So many variables. Maybe you can check below LinkedIn discussion. See whether it helps.

    I have only 1 yr exp in devops. Can you suggest some career path which will help me to grow as devops engineer.
