-   Start with a real story from yourself: it's ok to make fun of yourself, as long as it's real
-   Start with an easy and open question: either useful or funny
-   Explain your question in a simple and easy-to-understand way: People are careless and biasd
-   As long as people want to say something, and easy to chimp in mind


#### Maintain a topic

-   Ask the Right questions in a suitable question
-   Add a recap after 3 days: summarize the discussions
-   Speak out people's name, and speak with due respect!


#### Content Management

## Doc Templates


<a id="org84a41f7"></a>

### Doc: Invite people into slack

-   Introduce slack group

    This is a typical DevOps question.
    
    We have an active Slack group. #devops-101 channel might be helpful for your question.
    
    Would you like to join?

    BTW, we have an active Slack group. Slack brings people closer. I like it very much. 
    
    Would you like to join? Feel free to skip, if you're too busy for us

-   Why I choose slack over LinkedIn

    Sure thing. If you're in slack, send me a private message.
    
    Slack brings people closer. Thus we can help each other more effectively.
    
    Cheers!

<a id="org16b2f63"></a>

### Doc: Reject reply a specific question in LinkedIn

    XXX
    
    Looks like stack overflow is a better place for this kind of questions.
    
    F.Y.I 
    
    I usually use LinkedIn to ask for experience and directions. Instead of tech details.
    For specific issues, we usually can fix with enough reading and testing sooner or later.
    
    Hope you can conquer your puzzles soon?
